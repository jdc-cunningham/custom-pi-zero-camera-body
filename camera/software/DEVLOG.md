Trying to imagine how this will work

- boot, start `main.py` loop
- camera shutter press would trigger photo (fast signal kill type)
- back button
  - opens menu if nothing is active
  - d-pad to navigate, go in, back button to go up layer
- menu system
  - view files
  - bluetooth pair
    - shows transfer option
- d-pad center
  - zoom (magnify, show top-left quadrant)
    - can zoom more, pan
  - pan around
