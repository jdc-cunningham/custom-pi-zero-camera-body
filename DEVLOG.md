Damn I got sick... been sleeping last few days

I ran the 50% on 50% idle profiler and I actually forgot about it for a day or two (sleeping) and yeah it stayed up for 425 minutes

I had to manually set that (max_uptime) which is not great

I had a thought, the idle thing that turns the camera on/off should do the incrementer too, it'll be a little inaccurate but works out

This is odd... the runtime has a different value than what the test has, which is what the display is using... hmm

I think there is some collision when it initializes a new one...

I think it is working... but I want to test it/verify it as it counts
