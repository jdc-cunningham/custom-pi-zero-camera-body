Damn... my sleep pattern is off/sick still and I binge ate so I'm not in a productive state right now, I'm not doing anything groundbreaking it's just work so I think I can do it

I'll quickly get pytest going where I can assert something, see about integrating the pixelmatch

Oh man I can't sleep, I will hate myself tomorrow

Last day of work though

before I refactor the code, I have to write functional tests based on what exists already

I want to do visual testing, I did some preliminary research and it can be done

pytest + something like pixelmatch

so I will mock out the hardware, then write this tests

This is nice too since I can run this before merging and know I didn't screw it up
