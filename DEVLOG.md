I will write code today, I don't want to wait for the 3 days off I have from work

Won't be crazy progress but something

6:11 PM

damn I'm spent... will try

6:28 PM

There is a "system design" thing I still haven't seen/figured out yet

I have to make the pieces to see the bigger picture

6:35 PM

I'm glad for the Pi Zero 2 upgrade, it's snappy, easier to develop on

6:48 PM

Ooh... not even that far already having separation of concerns issues

7:11 PM

man I'm so tired... my eyes hurt lol

Trying to draw a box on an existing image, the other examples were on a basic black background

7:43 PM

Ugh... I need primitives, it's not dry

Also need to separate state from display logic eg. the menu vs. display code

7:44 PM

Ooh... I just had an idea... it could get annoying but when you point the camera at the ground, this chibi animation could briefly popup (blinking eyes)

That feature (blinking chibi animation) is on my list of things to do but for now just using that generated character

Damn I'm so tired... what I need to do is make this code simpler/reusable and then be able to pass in a flag (currently duplicated code) eg. if it's making a menu inactive it just flips the color of the line fill

The telemetry will show the IMU live readouts and details about the pi zero 1/2 eg. cores/ram/storage/etc... just data (excuse to show something cool)

the IMU thing I want the horizon level (it would go over a photo)

Tired af... have a headache

Printing the remaing lens parts... trying to do something for the menu

I had thought about having indidivual sprites that are stacked on top of the base image, this would make updates easier but you have to repaint them/stack in a row vs. paint 1 image once

7:44 PM

I'm not sure if this was a dream but while I was trying to/in the process of sleeping I thought about checking the variation/contrast from one pixel to the next (frame draw) and if it's not too drastic, keep it so only the new pixels get updated, this would be for the (desired) high FPS live preview.

This is so dumb it's hand drawn but it's not about the scenes (can be updated), just working on the flow.

I was also thinking for recording, red dot, side note no audio sucks, but also one less thing to worry about

11:05 PM

what the heck man... this lens cap is still too small, I'll have to do it again tomorrow, at least it's an hour print but still... this'll be the 3rd attempt

Feel slow today... printing stuff

Supposed to be designing the menu

2:56 AM

Still no motivation yet, maybe feeling something

4:00 PM

oh no... I measured wrong on the 35mm I measured including the base ring damn...

since it's printed orthogonal long ways, I was able to just slice off the excess.

I'll fix the design
