Damn I got sick... been sleeping last few days

I ran the 50% on 50% idle profiler and I actually forgot about it for a day or two (sleeping) and yeah it stayed up for 425 minutes

I had to manually set that (max_uptime) which is not great

I had a thought, the idle thing that turns the camera on/off should do the incrementer too, it'll be a little inaccurate but works out
