Tired af... have a headache

Printing the remaing lens parts... trying to do something for the menu

I had thought about having indidivual sprites that are stacked on top of the base image, this would make updates easier but you have to repaint them/stack in a row vs. paint 1 image once

7:44 PM

I'm not sure if this was a dream but while I was trying to/in the process of sleeping I thought about checking the variation/contrast from one pixel to the next (frame draw) and if it's not too drastic, keep it so only the new pixels get updated, this would be for the (desired) high FPS live preview.

This is so dumb it's hand drawn but it's not about the scenes (can be updated), just working on the flow.

I was also thinking for recording, red dot, side note no audio sucks, but also one less thing to worry about

Feel slow today... printing stuff

Supposed to be designing the menu

2:56 AM

Still no motivation yet, maybe feeling something

4:00 PM

oh no... I measured wrong on the 35mm I measured including the base ring damn...

since it's printed orthogonal long ways, I was able to just slice off the excess.

I'll fix the design
