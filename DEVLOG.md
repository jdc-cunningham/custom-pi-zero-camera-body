- mock out hardware
- do basic run test of pytest + pixelmatch to assert

Oh man I can't sleep, I will hate myself tomorrow

Last day of work though

before I refactor the code, I have to write functional tests based on what exists already

I want to do visual testing, I did some preliminary research and it can be done

pytest + something like pixelmatch

so I will mock out the hardware, then write this tests

This is nice too since I can run this before merging and know I didn't screw it up
