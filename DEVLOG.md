- mock out hardware
- do basic run test of pytest + pixelmatch to assert

I really should not be working on this project, I have my life that is in the process of imploding to worry about

But this set of 3-days that I have off was kind of wasted since I spent most of it being sick/recovering

I need to mock the hardware

1:29 PM

What I'm thinking is main.py should be able to run from the host OS terminal/IDE and the output (display) is a photo you can open up on the side

Hmm... I could use the keyboard to get input

Also could make a GUI with tkinter

I also don't feel like working on this ha

Yeap... ain't happenin, I gotta stop working on this project for a while

One day I do want to refactor it and use it in the spring/summer time

Damn... my sleep pattern is off/sick still and I binge ate so I'm not in a productive state right now, I'm not doing anything groundbreaking it's just work so I think I can do it

I'll quickly get pytest going where I can assert something, see about integrating the pixelmatch

Oh man I can't sleep, I will hate myself tomorrow

Last day of work though

before I refactor the code, I have to write functional tests based on what exists already

I want to do visual testing, I did some preliminary research and it can be done

pytest + something like pixelmatch

so I will mock out the hardware, then write this tests

This is nice too since I can run this before merging and know I didn't screw it up
