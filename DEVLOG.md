I wish I could say I was super excited/actively pursuing this. Right now the main thing on my mind is avoiding being homeless ha since I am unemployed/waiting to get my background check to work at amazon warehouse. This is all my own doing, I had a great job/quit, got another job slightly worse and that also didn't work out.

Anyway this is a project that I've had on my mind for a while/had the parts for but didn't get around to making.

I haven't worked on a hardware project since about 6 months ago. My most recent in-office job plus driving took about 11 hours of my day away every M-F.

I'm gonna get this done because it's a big project (lots of things to do) but I can still get it done in a few days. I'll just get lost it in for now.

I will also note yesterday I tried to reset my sleep pattern and I didn't finish it eg. slept at 9AM and woke up 6PM... so I'm kind of out of it.

I'm modeling the parts right now so I can arrange them in 3D space/get an idea of how big the body will be.

I am looking forward go going to the park when this is built and trying it out.

I haven't been to the park in idk 4 months looks like.
