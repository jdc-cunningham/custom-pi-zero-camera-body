### Who is this camera for?

This camera is not about quality. You obviously can't compare this to a real camera eg. a Sony Alpha. This camera is about writing your own software/a stepping stone for other camera designs.

The 5V 1A micro usb charger's discharge cut off is very low around 2.5V, keep that in mind depending on your battery.
